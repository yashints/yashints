## Hi thanks for visiting Yas's GitHub page 👋

Yas is an almond croissant addict celeverly disguised as a web developer. He is a technical writer (distiguished author of the year on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/yashints)), international speaker, and a community advocate. By day he plays the role of a lead consultant at Telstra Purple, the biggest professional services in Australia, and by night he does nothing (someone needs to take care of the kids 😁).

If you want to find out more about him:
